# rust-never
Rust has a type called [never](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.never.html)(`!`).
It's used to represent the type that is never initiated.

But currently, never type is a night-only feature and cannot be used in the stable build.
This library is an alternative implementation of never type for the stable rust.
